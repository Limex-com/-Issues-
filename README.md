### Limex Issue Tracker

This repository is meant to act as a centralized collection of any bugs or feature requests for the Limex DataHub. If your question relates to a specific API library maintained by Limex, please open your issue in that library's repository instead. Please also check our API documentation for answers before opening an issue.

### Opening Tickets (Use the templates)

Before opening a new ticket to ask a question or request a feature, please search in the existing issues to see if there's a similar ticket open. If so, feel free to add your thoughts as a comment, or just give the ticket a thumbs-up reaction to indicate that you feel it's important.

If you don't find an existing issue similar enough to your situation, you can open a new issue, following the appropriate template. Please fill out as much information as possible within the template, as that will allow us to address your issues much faster.
